I'm Xiangzhe, a Ph.D. student at Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). I obtained my B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University.
My research interest focuses on combining machine learning techniques with binary program analysis.
Specifically, I am working on recovering high-level information (e.g., program behaviors, variable names, types) from lower-level programs (e.g., stripped binary programs).
I use program analysis to construct better features from programs (e.g., [input/output values reflecting dynamic program behaviors](pem.pdf), [state machine reflecting input specifications](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity23-shi-qingkai.pdf)); and enhance the performance of machine learning models with program analysis techniques (e.g., making binary program models more robust by [preventing models emphasizing on binary instructions that are not import for program semantics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3597926.3598121), improving the performance of LLM on recovering variable names from binary programs by [formulating name recovery as a type-inference like task](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02546.pdf)).
